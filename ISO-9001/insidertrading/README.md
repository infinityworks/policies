# Purpose

To define the policy prohibiting insider trading and stock tipping by directors, employees and contractors of Infinity Works Consulting Limited (“Infinity Works”).  

Under the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and the Market Abuse Regulations insider trading is prohibited.  

## Scope

This policy applies to the Infinity Works board of directors, all employees and all contractors.

## What is Insider Trading and Stock Tipping?

For these purposes, insider trading is the trading of equities on public markets (whether directly or via a third party) whilst in the possession of material confidential or non-public information. Stock tipping is the disclosure of material inside information to enable the recipient of that information to buy or sell equities on the basis of such information. These are serious offences that can result in civil and criminal penalties.

## What is Material Information?

Information is considered "material" if a reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding whether to buy, sell or retain equities. Material information may be either good or bad and is not limited to financial information. Some examples of inside information include: financial forecasts or results, product information, marketing plans, proposed acquisitions or divestitures, strategic plans or information about significant product or service developments.

## Policy

Infinity Works expects all directors, employees and contractors to not misuse and to guard against the misuse of confidential information in the trading of equities on public markets (whether directly or via a third party).  Infinity Works expects its directors, employees and contractors to comply fully with the laws prohibiting insider trading and stock tipping.

## Responsibilities

All directors, employees and contractors have responsibility for promptly reporting violations or alleged or suspected violations of this policy to the Infinity Works legal team. All reports of suspected or alleged violations of this policy will be investigated. Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action including termination of contract and/or civil and criminal prosecution.

If you are uncertain about any elements of this policy or have any questions about it, please notify your manager or the Legal Team as soon as possible.
