# Code of Conduct Policy
## Policy brief & purpose

Our Employee Code of Conduct company policy outlines our expectations regarding employees’ behaviour towards their colleagues, supervisors and overall organisation. 
We promote freedom of expression and open communication. But we expect all employees to follow our code of conduct. They should avoid offending, participating in serious disputes and disrupting our workplace. We also expect them to foster a well-organized, respectful and collaborative environment.

## Scope
This policy applies to all our employees regardless of employment agreement or rank. 

## Summary
Our people and our culture are Infinity Works’ most valuable assets and we are wholly committed to protecting them.

Therefore, Infinity Works will not tolerate any instances of harassing or discriminatory behaviour towards other employees or our guests. As an Infinity Works employee or visitor you are expected to adhere to this so as to ensure a safe working space for everyone.

If you are being harassed at work or notice somebody else may be, tell your advocate or a member of your local board immediately. If you are not an Infinity Works employee, please talk to a member of the People Ops team.

## Our Pledge
Infinity Works pledge to provide a safe, friendly, and welcoming working environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other fellow employees and visitors


Examples of unacceptable behavior by employees or visitors include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Any practices or rules which place certain groups at a disadvantage, such as people with a disability
- Microaggressions: expressing remarks or a subtly different attitude towards people belonging to certain groups, based on biases or preconceptions
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities
As a company, Infinity Works is responsible for providing a safe and inclusive working environment for their employees and guests. Infinity Works aims to cultivate such an environment by actively and continuously assessing the opinions of its employees with regard to Diversity and Inclusion, and using this information to drive business policy and process change. Furthermore, it is Infinity Works’ duty to establish accessible and confidential channels for people to report issues, and to act upon these with the highest urgency.

As an employee or visitor of Infinity Works, you are responsible for adhering to this Code of Conduct, ensuring your fellow peers and guests are aware of it, and reporting any behaviour which you find violates these terms.

## Enforcement
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated in confidentiality and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Employees or visitors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions, as determined by the board.
We expect employees to not abuse their employment benefits. This can refer to time off, insurance, facilities, subscriptions or other benefits our company offers.

## Compliance 
All employees must protect our company’s legality. They should comply with all environmental, safety and fair dealing laws. We expect employees to be ethical and responsible when dealing with our company’s finances, products, partnerships and public image. All employees must also read and follow our company policies.
