# Infinity Works - Policies

## Overview

OK, now before you panic about the sheer volume of reading that lays ahead of you we do actually want you to take this a little seriously. As Ron would say “it’s kind of a big deal!”

The policies included here ensure IW conform to a number of industry standards. Beyond that though, they're in-place to help run a secure and reputable business for our employees and customers.

So grab a cuppa, sit comfortably and start reading.

## Security Policies

Why do we have security policies in the first place? Well, for one it’ll make sure we don’t get into any unnecessary trouble and perhaps do something accidental that might implicate a person, our company or a client. Also, by having these policies we will demonstrate to our clients that we take security seriously and won’t let ourselves or them down. Plus, it will unlock more doors to more clients in the future who count on this level of security from us.

## Quality Management

The phrase 'Quality Management' might not immediately resonate with you. In this context, 'Quality Management' describes the processes that underpin how we function as a company and how we deliver services to our customers.
The Organisation operates a Quality Management System that is ISO-9001 compliant, including aspects specific to the provision of IT services and software development. It's important we all understand these policies, they underpin IW's commitment to its customers and to its staff.

### Which standards to we adhere to?

We are compliant with both **ISO-27001**, **ISO-9001*  and **Cyber Essentials +**.
