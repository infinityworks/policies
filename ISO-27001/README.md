# Infinity Works - Information Security Management System

## Overview

The policies set out here dictate the security controls that underpin our commitment to the security of both Infinity Works systems and data and that of our customers. The policies detailed below help Infinity Works achieve both ISO-27001 and Cyber Essentials + compliance.

## Why are we implementing ISO27001?

For one, it'll make sure we don't get into any unnecessary trouble and perhaps do something accidental that might implicate a person, our company or a client.

Also, by having these policies we will demonstrate to our clients that we take security seriously and won't let ourselves or them down.
Plus, it will unlock more doors to more clients in the future who count on this level of security from us.

So once you've read and understood these policies we'd really like you to accept them which you can do by clicking on the link at the very bottom of this page

Sound good? OK let's get started!!

## What about Cyber Essentials +?

We've brought the policies that underpin our ISO-27001 compliance inline with Cyber Essentials Plus requirements. Adherence to the policies set out here, also then supports our compliance with the controls set out by Cyber Essentials +.
